# js-eval README
This extension is intended to make short evaluations from the highlighted/selected text in your Javascript File.
After an expression you want to calculate has been selected, the result will update live on the statusbar(left bottom corner).

JS EVAL is able to use both numbers and variables, even though the variables are defined outside of the selected text.
It currently does not support arrays, object and functions, as it is intended for small evaluations and finding the latest assigned value to a selected variable.

If you want to support me so I can continue developing and extending features, you can buy me a redbull here:

If you encounter any bugs, have any feedback on features you'd like me to implement, don't hesitate to reach out.



## Features

Evaluate the selected text.
\!\[Example 1\]\(images\EXAMPLE 1.png\)
Get variable values from outside the selected text.
\!\[Example 2\]\(images\EXAMPLE 2.png\)
A variable can also get its value from other variables.
\!\[Example 3\]\(images\EXAMPLE 3.png\)
It is able to evaluate if a variables value is assigned to an expression(Even if the expression itself contains variables).
Selected text inline will also be evaluated correctly.
